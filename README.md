## Has any promise rejected?

On the study and development using JS I encontered a problem with promises.

What coul'd happen on processing a list of async taks with one of then gets rejected?

So, I made this repo within approches to the problem that has none solution on JS language itself.

PS:

Made two, on imperative version other on a more functional version.
Boths are the same, but with diferent implications.

Keep the heads up.
